      The idea for HyperCast was born out of my personal frustration with existing weather apps.
      Many were cluttered, inaccurate, or lacked the level of detail I needed to plan my day or trips effectively.
      I wanted to create a weather app that was not only visually appealing but also provided comprehensive and reliable forecasts.
